## Project Overview

This project is a collection of Processing files that each showcase an element of art or a principle of design. This project helped me connect the world of design with the world of computer science. All of the files make use of the Processing-specific features, and this project also served as a Java refresher. Some of the topics explored include coordinate systems, 3D shape transformations (scaling, rotating, etc.), lighting, and much more.

## Running the Files

1. Clone the repository.

2. Ensure Processing is installed on your system. 
    - *Made with Processing 4.4.7*

3. Open the desired file and run the code.
    - *Some files feature interaction via the mouse!*
